React Next and TypeScript Review 3
==================================
Build a single-page weather app (start a new app for this)
Use the API at 
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=hull,uk&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1
  (this includes my API key, good for 60 requests per minute. You can sign up for free for your own API key)

Aim for good architecture with modular construction 
Choose a strategy to fetch the API data

Details
-------
- Ask the user for a 'city' and a 'country' (hull and uk in the example)
- Use these values to make a request to the API (handle problems elegantly)
- From the response.json, show the weather description and temperature
	weather[0][description] and main.temp
- You may choose to show other data members

Optional
--------
- Avoid 'any' as a type 
- Ensure the weather data is type-safe (e.g. write a type, interface or class)
- validate user input, either as non-empty strings (required) or as permitted values
- persist the most-recent user options so that they are retrieved when the page first loads
  (Use them to pre-populate the form fields)
- consider a strategy to cache the weather response for a particular request
  (use the cached values if the same request is made within two minutes)
- As weather reports are retrieved, show them nicely in a table
- And/or render a chart showing each city and the temperature
