React Next and TypeScript Review 3
==================================
Build a single-page weather app (start a new app for this)
- if using next.js remember to say "use client" in the components
Use the API at 
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=hull,uk&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1
  (this includes my API key, good for 60 requests per minute. You can sign up for free for your own API key)

Aim for good architecture with modular construction 
Choose where state should be managed
Choose a strategy to fetch the API data

Details
-------
- Ask the user for a 'city' and a 'country' (hull and uk in the example)
- Use these values to make a request to the API (handle problems elegantly)
- From the response.json, show the weather description and temperature
	weather[0][description] and main.temp
- You may choose to show other data members
- Make use of the React Dev Tools where necessary

Optional
--------
- Avoid 'any' as a type 
- Ensure the weather data is type-safe (e.g. write a type, interface or class)
- validate user input, either as non-empty strings (required) or as permitted values
- persist the most-recent user options so that they are retrieved when the page first loads
  (Use them to pre-populate the form fields)
- consider a strategy to cache the weather response for a particular request
  (use the cached values if the same request is made within two minutes)
- As weather reports are retrieved, show them nicely in a table
- And/or render a chart showing each city and the temperature

If Time
-------
- Consider features of chart or table to make them more interactive (e.g. sort/filter)
- use the API at https://ipapi.co to find hte users location then automatically retrieve the weather
- Make the weather retrieval happen automatically on a time-basis
