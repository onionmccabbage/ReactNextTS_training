========
Either continue with the 'Weather' app or build a new app as follows:
Ask the user for a category and a number
Request data from the API at https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/
(replace 'people' with the chosen category and '1' with the chosen number)

Focus on the form and validation:
- Category may be 'people', 'planets', 'species'
- Number can be 1 to 10 (though some categories may not cover all numbers)

Show the 'name' from the resulting data on the page

Optional
--------
Each category returns different data structures
- people returns name, eye-color etc
- planets returns name, roational-period etc
- species returns name, language etc
Implement a strategy to show the relevant data based on the category
- could use routing
- could use class/interface types descended from a top-level 'swapi' class
